# OpenCV_Projects

This repository contains any projects I've accomplished either with research, 
projects, or online classes I will refernce. My main focus is to study fields crossing over Machine Learning (Convolutional Neural Network, Support Vector Machines, and Clustering for K-Maps), Computer Vision, and Data Science so I can work with Self Driving Cars.

For my online class: The material I plan on learning will be on the following topics. 

Image Processing. Learn some of the basics of image processing such as blurring an image, understanding image morphology, geometric transforms, and image histograms.

Segmenting Images and Obtaining Interesting Points. Apply different algorithms to cluster data, segment images, as well as find and match interesting points in an image.

Computational Photography. Create panoramas, remove unwanted objects from photos, enhance low light photographs, and work with High Dynamic Range (HDR) images.

Recognizing Objects. Detect different shapes, faces, people, and learn how to train a detector to detect custom objects and to recognize faces.

Calibration and Stereo Images. Learn how to calibrate cameras, remove distortion from images, change the 3D perspective of photographs, and work with stereo images to represent depth information.
