# OpenCV_Projects

This repository includes any projects that I have completed with research, projects, or online classes that I will refer to. My main focus is on studying fields that cross Machine Learning (Convolutionary Neural Network, Support Vector Machines, and Clustering of K-means), Computer Vision, and Data Science so I can work with Self Driving Cars.

For my online class: The material I plan on learning will be on the following topics. 

Image Processing. Learn some of the basics of image processing such as blurring an image, understanding image morphology, geometric transforms, and image histograms.

Segmenting Images and Obtaining Interesting Points. Apply different algorithms to cluster data, segment images, as well as find and match interesting points in an image.

Computational Photography. Create panoramas, remove unwanted objects from photos, enhance low light photographs, and work with High Dynamic Range (HDR) images.

Recognizing Objects. Detect different shapes, faces, people, and learn how to train a detector to detect custom objects and to recognize faces.

Calibration and Stereo Images. Learn how to calibrate cameras, remove distortion from images, change the 3D perspective of photographs, and work with stereo images to represent depth information.
